# EV Analysis - GIS Portfolio Project

A comprehensive spatial analysis project focused on Electric Vehicle (EV) infrastructure, adoption patterns, and related socio-economic factors using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize various aspects of electric vehicle adoption and infrastructure through spatial data analysis. It combines demographic, economic, infrastructure, and satellite data to provide insights into EV accessibility and adoption patterns.

## Features (Planned)

- **Spatial Analysis**: Analyze EV infrastructure distribution and accessibility
- **Demographic Integration**: Correlate EV adoption with demographic factors
- **Economic Analysis**: Examine relationships between economic indicators and EV infrastructure
- **Satellite Data Processing**: Utilize satellite imagery for land use and urban planning insights
- **Interactive Mapping**: Generate interactive and static maps for visualization
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Automated report generation with key findings
